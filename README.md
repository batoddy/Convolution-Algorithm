# Convolution-Algorithm
A convolution is a type of matrix operation, consisting of a kernel, a small matrix of weights, that slides over input data performing element-wise multiplication with the part of the input it is on, then summing the results into an output.
This algorithm can filter a MxN matrix with KxK filter matrix.
